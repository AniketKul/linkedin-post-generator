Please find a Linkedin posts.json file attached here. I want you to read it and then use "post_text" and "hashtags" fields to convert to a json file as per example shown below -

Example Text:

Software Engineering isn't easy. 
It requires thorough understanding of basic concepts.

Output Text:

{
    "text": "Software Engineering isn't easy.\nIt requires thorough understanding of basic concepts.",
    "engagement": 0,
}

Now please convert this text -

"post_text": "If someone asked me to visualize what 2024 looked like for Sequent - this image says it all! For the second time this year, I'm trying to finish a project that is larger than anything I've ever undertaken (this time a book), and it would have been *so lovely* to have read this wonderful piece by Dave Stewart BEFORE I started. He published this back in 2022, and it resurfaced here on LinkedIn late last week, in a post by Allie Miller. You can check it out yourself at https://lnkd.in/enAsDTJg

"hashtags": [
    "#systemdesign",
    "#development",
    "#weekend",
    "#learningeveryday"
]

Please give me the final json file to download at the end.
